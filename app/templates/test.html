            <p class="lead">1. <b>Transit Score:</b> This is a measure of the proximity to public transit. In San Francisco, this is the most important variable in predicting sale price.</p>
	            <p class="lead">2. <b>Year Built:</b> The year the house was built is the second most important variable in TruValuation's model.</p>
		            <p class="lead">3. <b>Walk Score:</b> This is a measure of the walkability of a neighborhood, proximity to restaurants, grocery stores and pedestrian friendliness.</p>
